				I was thinking what to do this October? So I took the closest thing around me, it had to be spooky, but cute in the same time.
				<br />
				Not forgetting the touch of fun and cartoon as I like that kind of style.
			</p>
			<p>
				I did a quick sketch (very fast) just to give me a rough imagination. After that, I tweaked it in the Zbrush.
				<br />
				It took around 2 weeks and everything was done in Zbrush and render it in C4D Redshift.

			<p>
				I was excited with the new software called <a href="https://spline.design/">Spline.Tool</a>
				<br />
				This software is kinda unique and different with the other 3d software. Why?
				<br />
				It's because the software is designed for web and mobile application. 
				<br />
				Of course, it's also realtime! So, you're able to have a new experiene to play with your 3D with music and movement.

				That time, I was joined the small competition from Spline community.
				<br />
				There are no prize for the competition, but I did this as a motivation for myself and I'm quite happy with the result.
				<br />
				Not win as the 1st winner, but I was chosen as a best cartoon character ⭐🐸
